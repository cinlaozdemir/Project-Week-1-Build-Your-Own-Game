## Project Description
I'm building a strong random password generator with 16 digits.
## Rules

The code generates a 16 digit password that includes letters, numbers and punctuation. The letters are generated from the input taken from the user, which is their name. The numbers are the year of birth and the rest of the password is generated with random punctuation.

## Workflow

The code asks for the name and year of birth from the user and combines them. Then decides how many punctuation symbols are needed to complete 16 digits in total. Proceeds to combine letters, numbers and punctuation symbols all together and shuffles them. Generates the password and then checks the strength of the password to see if it's strong enough.

## Organization
I used Trello to organize my work, I wrote all the main steps that needed to be done there and updated it as I went along the way.
My repo has a Kick-off file, and a folder called "your-project". The folder "your-project" has a .gitignore file, the last version of my code and this README file.
